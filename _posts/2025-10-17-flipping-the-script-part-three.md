tl;dr - 800mg L-Theanine every 5 hours may be effective for improving compulsive behaviour caused by extreme doses of modafinil

# Experiment
I was already using L-Theanine every 3-4 hours at 200-400mg because it suppresses the panic that ends up gripping me when I take insane doses of modafinil/armodafinil + large (large in the normal range) amounts of kratom with large (normal) amounts of caffeine (coffee).

I tried increasing the doses to 800mg L-Theanine and dosed it every 5 hours to see if it would improve things and the first full day I did this I ended up using half the amount of armodafinil that I would normally use. I consumed 1500mg armodafinil over the course of the day instead of the 2250-3000mg I had used every day for quite a number of days before that. Another notable difference was that I took the last dose at 6am instead of redosing several times well into the afternoon or sometimes even night time like on previous days. It's just one day, it's a couple of significant improvements but the reason I am writing this up is that it fits the hypothesis - reversing the GABA suppression that modafinil/armodafinil cause ended up causing behavioural improvements.

I will continue to use high dose L-Theanine with modafinil/armodafinil to see if this consistently improves my behaviour.

I have also continued to use Lemorexant most days since starting to use it.
