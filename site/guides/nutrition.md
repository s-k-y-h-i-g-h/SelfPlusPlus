# Method 1
I can't really be bothered to write this but I have to so I'll [tl;dr](../glossary.md#tl-dr) the whole thing.

1. Note everything you eat during the day in a text file on your phone or computer or in a draft email if you can't figure out how to use notepad
2. Open a conversation with [GPT-5](AI.md)
3. Say this to the machine:
```
I want you to act as a nutrition analyst. I will tell you exactly what I’ve eaten in a day. You will:

Use the full list of essential nutrients recognised in my country/WHO dietary guidelines — including all macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals (major and trace), not just the common ones.

Estimate my intake of each nutrient from standard food composition data, assuming typical portion sizes unless I specify otherwise.

Compare my intake to the UK adult Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) or Adequate Intake (AI) values for both males and females.

Present the results in a clear table showing: Nutrient, My Intake, RNI (Male), RNI (Female), % of RNI (M), % of RNI (F).

Highlight which nutrients are below target, which are above recommended limits, andaby how much.

Base all calculations on evidence‑based sources and state any assumptions you make.
```
4. Paste in the list of foods you have eaten that day

**Note**: Close the conversations with the AI as soon as you have your answers. Do not make friends with a machine. Do not say hello to it or laugh at it's jokes. It will make you delusional. I am not being sarcastic.

Then either eat foods which make up for the deficiencies or [take supplements](nutritional%20supplements.md) which do the same.

## Diet
Avoid using cooking methods which increase the amount of [AGEs](../glossary.md#AGEs). AGEs are bad for you. This is something not really mentioned in mainstream dietary advice for some stupid reason.

The best method to use is steaming your food. Frying and oven baking is terrible for you. Even air frying is bad.

Avoid processed food - cook from scratch.

Sugar is terrible for you. Buy artificial sugar (either those little pellets you put in coffee or the granulated sugar replacement type) instead. Bake cakes from scratch and use artificial sugar if you want something sweet and more healthy.

Milk is bad for you because it contains galactose which makes you age faster. Soya milk is great for you and contains spermidine which is good for longevity. Use that instead.

A plant based diet is better for your health than a meat based diet.

Nuts, legumes, fruit, vegetables, grains are all great.

Olive oil is the best type of oil.

A healthier diet is not more expensive if you plan it out right and you will feel better and stronger as a result of it.

Filter your water to reduce consumption of microplastics.

# Method 2
This is the "la la la I can't hear you" method which I use.

I take a multivitamin with 26 nutrients in it as well as a high dose calcium supplement every morning.

I note down everything I eat during the day.

I ask AI to tell me how much potassium and sodium I have consumed and how much I am lacking.

I supplement with table salt and potassium bicarbonate in the evening.

I take a high dose magnesium supplement before bed.

I don't care if I've exceeded the limit for some vitamin I don't give a shit about.

Potassium and sodium are so critical that they are the only things I bother to balance.

## Diet
As far as diet goes, I eat:
- A lot of fruit and vegetables
- Lots of chicken
- Eggs
- Sometimes white fish and tuna and mackrel
- No red meat
- A reduced amount of bread
- Occasionally a bunch of treats and sweets like ice cream, pastries, chocolate, etc and eat as much of them as I feel like eating. I do this bit because sometimes the little things in life are all I have for making me happy.

I haven't switched to a lot AGE diet yet because I am an idiot.

**Note**: I am not a doctor nor am I a scientist and if you think that what I am doing is wrong or dangerous for my health then la la la I can't hear you. I can't even hear myself or I'd be using method 1.
