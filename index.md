Self++ is a project designed to take you and add a little bit more to improve you and your capabilities past what is normally possible. 

This isn't just for healthy people - if you are suffering from health problems then we intend to help you to overcome them too.

We have provided an [overview](site/overview.md) of this site to serve as an introduction to biohacking, nootropics and transhumanism. It assumes no knowledge of these things and anyone with even an incomplete or informal education should be able to understand it. All that's required is that you can read English. If anything remains unclear please see [this page about improving clarity](site/claify.md).

This is an [open source project](site/oss.md). It is open to everyone both to use and to modify.

This project is the result of one biohackers need to share the cool stuff they've found and learned.
