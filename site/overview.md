What, were you expecting a paragraph about what biohacking is? Lol.

## Good Health

[tl;dr](glossary.md#tl-dr) - [nutrition guide](../site/guides/nutrition.md)

If the goal is to take a healthy person and improve them past what is normally possible then we first need to make sure that they are healthy, right? 

We can test if they are healthy by measuring their vitals, doing blood tests, doing scans of their brain and body, right? If you can do that - if you have the money for it - then do it as soon as possible! If you care about your friends and family then don't. Don't pay for tests for them. Don't let them leech off you. This is a game of survival and their survival might one day block yours.

What you can do if you can't afford those things or you are waiting for tests is implement changes to your lifestyle, habits and diet which are critical for good health. Doing this will be necessary either way and if you can't afford tests and do it then you can probably be reasonably sure that you are healthy some months after you make those changes (in my humble opinion and in my limited experience).

#### Standards

All sorts of national and international organisations have already done so much hard work for us. Scientists have identified things essential for good health and your government(s) have made information available to you about this through various websites, paper resources, etc. This is still a moving target, though we can be reasonably sure that the foundations will not change - new research is constantly being conducted and we are finding out new ways to keep the body and brain healthy all the time.

"Healthy" has a solid definition grounded in solid science. If we set aside health conditions and illnesses for a minute then "healthy" is determined by:
- [BMI](gloassary.md#BMI)
- Whether your [vitals](glossary.md#vitals) are within a particular range
- Waist-to-hip ratio
- Metabolic markers 
- Blood markers

Essential nutrients like vitamins and minerals, protein, carbohydrates and fats and water all have recommended daily amounts recommended limits which you should not exceed.

Taken together, "healthy" in the sense that your doctor is talking about means that the measurements are within range and that your body has enough of and not too much of a bunch of things. Let's call this [Medically Healthy](glossary.md#medically-healthy).

We've put together a [guide](guides/nutrition.md) about how to make sure that you are getting all the nutrients that health standards say you need.
