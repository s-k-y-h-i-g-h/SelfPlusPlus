I've started self-administering 5mg Lemborexant every night for insomnia treatment. It's highly effective and blocks one of the mechanisms armodafinil which cause it's wakefulness-promoting effect.

> [LEM5 and LEM10 had significant benefit on sleep onset and sleep maintenance compared with placebo, and importantly, lemborexant effectiveness persisted at twelve months, suggesting that lemborexant may provide long-term benefits for subjects with insomnia.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945721000654)

It's very effective and works long term.

One problem solved!
