# Method 1
I can't really be bothered to write this but I have to so I'll [tl;dr](../glossary.md#tl-dr) the whole thing.

1. Note everything you eat during the day in a text file on your phone or computer or in a draft email if you can't figure out how to use notepad
2. Open a conversation with [GPT-5](AI.md)
3. Say this to the machine:
```
I want you to act as a nutrition analyst. I will tell you exactly what I’ve eaten in a day. You will:

Use the full list of essential nutrients recognised in my country/WHO dietary guidelines — including all macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals (major and trace), not just the common ones.

Estimate my intake of each nutrient from standard food composition data, assuming typical portion sizes unless I specify otherwise.

Compare my intake to the UK adult Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) or Adequate Intake (AI) values for both males and females.

Present the results in a clear table showing: Nutrient, My Intake, RNI (Male), RNI (Female), % of RNI (M), % of RNI (F).

Highlight which nutrients are below target, which are above recommended limits, and by how much.

Base all calculations on evidence‑based sources and state any assumptions you make.
```
4. Paste in the list of foods you have eaten that day

Then either eat foods which make up for the deficiencies or [take supplements](nutritional%20supplements.md) which do the same.

**Note**: Close the conversations with the AI as soon as you have your answers. Do not make friends with a machine. Do not say hello to it or laugh at it's jokes. It will make you live in a delusional world where people run on x86 and x86 is still used by anyone.

# Method 2
This is the "la la la I can't hear you" method which I use.

I take a multivitamin with 26 nutrients in it as well as a high dose calcium supplement every morning.

I note down everything I eat during the day.

I ask AI to tell me how much potassium and sodium I have consumed and how much I am lacking.

I supplement with table salt and potassium bicarbonate in the evening.

I take a high dose magnesium supplement before bed.

I don't care if I've exceeded the limit for some vitamin I don't give a shit about.

Potassium and sodium are so critical that they are the only things I bother to balance.

**Note**: I am not a doctor nor am I a scientist and if you think that what I am doing is wrong or dangerous for my health then la la la I can't hear you. I can't even hear myself or I'd be using method 1.
