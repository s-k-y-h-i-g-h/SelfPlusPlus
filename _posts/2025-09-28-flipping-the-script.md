tl;dr - Hypothesis: if I have a compound for each of a drug's mechanisms of action which blocks/reverses one of the mechanisms then the control this provides could make the drug easy to tame, even if it is addictive.

# Experiment

I have been using crazy high doses of modafinil and armodafinil on a daily basis. By crazy I mean that I have been averaging 2-4g of modafinil or 1.5-3g of armodafinil per day. The anti-oxidants in my stack are consumed regularly throughout the day which, I hope, have been protecting me from the damage that these doses cause - at least to an extent. Modafinil is not typically considered to be particularly addictive but at these doses I think that the DAT inhinition is high enough for it to be reinforcing for me. It's around 60% at high doses in the normal range (i.e. 400mg/day of modafinil) AFAIR. So at 2-4g the DAT inhibition could be much higher, though I lack the education to guesstimate how much it could be. I think this is why I find these drugs to be addictive enough to feel compelled to take them every day and I think I am using high doses to maximise DAT inhbition. I don't know enough about the mechanisms of addiction to understand if other mechanisms of modafinil/armodafinil are causing them to be addictive for me.

Terrible side effects of this kind of use are the severely impacted quality of sleep, consistency of sleep and ability to sleep in the first place. I often find myself sleeping every other day, or sleeping every day but only for a couple of hours.

I am testing my hypothesis by trying to use an orexin antagonist to reverse on of modafinil/armodafinil's mechanisms of action, which is one of the mechanisms responsible for it to be wakefulness-promoting, to allow me to get to sleep every night. The compound I am going to use for this is Lemborexant.
