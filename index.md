Self++ is a project designed to take you and add a little bit more to improve you and your capabilities past what is normally possible. 

This isn't just for healthy people - if you are suffering from health problems then we intend to help you to overcome them too.

We have provided an [overview](site/overview.md) of this site to serve as an introduction to biohacking, nootropics and transhumanism. All that's required is that you can read English. It assumes no knowledge of these things and anyone with even an incomplete or informal education should be able to understand it. If anything remains unclear please see [this page about improving clarity](site/claify.md).

This is an [open source project](site/oss.md). It is open to everyone both to use and to modify.

This is the culmination of one biohacker's frustrations and inspirations. I have been using nootropics since my early 20's (I am in my late 30's). I have seen and experienced life in a wide range of levels of comfort and accessibility. I want to take what I have seen and lived and solve problems which people who have not seen the difference between what people who have absolutely nothing and people who have relatively much have to deal with. Sometimes perspective is invaluable when trying to understand the shape of a problem. Some perspectives can only be come by if you fall at just the wrong angle and slip through a dozen cracks. 

Some falls are irrecoverable. But maybe luck exists, maybe that's why I am typing this. I need to stop people from falling and help people up because maybe, just maybe, I am the only person who has fallen so far and knows the way back up from there. And maybe I am the only person who understands the shape of a certain problem and can create safety nets and ladders which work on many, if not all, levels. Maybe every level looks different until you've seen a particular number of them - maybe then you see a self-similarity which is impossible to see otherwise. The proof is in the pudding, right? If I had explained everything that happened and how far I have moved and how quickly I did it then you'd already have your proof. But let's do this backwards, for fun.

I don't say "I am the only person" lightly, by the way. How many biohackers are there? Not many. How many have been hit with as many problems as me? Probably close to none. So how many people know how to get up from where I was? Maybe just me. How many people have fallen that far? Someone would have to get back up and talk about it for us to know that "that far" exists, right? How many times have you read something like this?

For what it's worth, I consider the default lifestyle and circumstances of a western person to be in a "fallen" state. Even well off people have less than what I'd call a reasonable quality of life when you consider their health, happiness and trajectory. Solving this requires niche and obscure knowledge. I haven't seen a single comprehensive resource which explains this from the ground up and covers everything that is possible.
