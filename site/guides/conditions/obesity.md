# Treating Obesity

I don't know much about this aside from that GLP-1 agonists are a huge deal and work for most people. I also know a lot about losing weight very fast, staying very lean while still enjoying huge meals and occasional junk food and how to manipulate various aspects of my experience, including my apetite.

I haven't had my DNA sequenced but I probably don't have any genes associated with obesity. My experience with it has only been second hand.

# GLP-1 Agonists (Weight Loss Medication)

If you're going to use these then it's worth looking at the range of GLP-1 agonists that exist, not just the popular one called Ozempic. Some of them are *much* cheaper and here's a [guide for finding vendors for supplements, medications and drugs online](../vendors.md).

| Drug (Generic)       | Common Brand(s)       | Typical Form       | Usual Dosing         | Avg. U.S. Online Price (No Insurance) | Notes |
|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------|
| Semaglutide          | Ozempic, Wegovy       | Weekly injection   | 0.25–2.4 mg          | $499–$1,350/month                       | Wegovy is weight‑loss‑labelled; Ozempic is diabetes‑labelled but often used off‑label for weight loss |
| Liraglutide          | Saxenda, Victoza      | Daily injection    | 0.6–3.0 mg           | $299–$1,200/month                       | Generic liraglutide sometimes available online from $299/month |
| Dulaglutide          | Trulicity             | Weekly injection   | 0.75–4.5 mg          | $650–$950/month                         | Primarily for type 2 diabetes; some off‑label weight loss use |
| Tirzepatide          | Mounjaro, Zepbound    | Weekly injection   | 2.5–15 mg            | $550–$1,060/month                       | Zepbound is weight‑loss‑labelled; Mounjaro is diabetes‑labelled |
| Exenatide            | Byetta, Bydureon      | Injection          | 5–10 µg [BID](../../glossary.md#bid) / 2 mg weekly | $300–$700/month                     | Less commonly used now; shorter half‑life |
| Oral semaglutide     | Rybelsus              | Daily tablet       | 3–14 mg              | $850–$1,000/month                       | Only oral GLP‑1 option; absorption is lower than injectable |

Note that these are prices for prescriptions. If you just buy the actual medication and administer it yourself then it might be much cheaper. If you buy from an Indian or Chinese pharmacy then the prices will probably be a fraction of these ones. The prices here were included to give you an idea of the relative cost of each medication.

# Apetite
I sometimes hear people joking that solving obesity is as simple as eating less and, assuming that you make sure you get all your [nutritional needs](../nutrition.md) met, that is as simple as reducing your apetite, right?

## What Controls Apetite?
> Appetite is regulated by a multi‑layered network of brain circuits, neurotransmitters, and hormones, with both homeostatic (energy‑balance) and hedonic (reward‑driven) components.
>
> 🧠 Central (Brain) Regulators -  Neurotransmitters & Precursors
> 
> - **Dopamine** — reward, motivation, [mixed effects on] food‑seeking behaviour. [Higher baseline dopamine level suppresses hunger.]
> - **Noradrenaline** — arousal, attention, appetite suppression at high levels.
> - **Serotonin** — satiety signalling; high serotonin activity reduces carbohydrate cravings.
> - **Tryptophan** — amino acid precursor to serotonin; availability can influence mood and satiety.
> - **Tyrosine** — amino acid precursor to dopamine/noradrenaline; can modulate alertness and appetite indirectly.
> - **GABA** — inhibitory tone; certain GABAergic pathways can promote feeding.
> - **Endocannabinoids** (e.g., anandamide) — stimulate appetite via CB1 receptors.
> - **Orexin / Hypocretin** — promotes wakefulness and food‑seeking.
> - **Neuropeptide Y (NPY)** — one of the most potent appetite stimulators.
> - **Agouti‑related peptide (AgRP)** — works with NPY to drive hunger.
> - **Pro‑opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons** — release α‑MSH, which suppresses appetite via melanocortin receptors.
> - **CART** (cocaine‑ and amphetamine‑regulated transcript) — appetite‑suppressing neuropeptide.
> 
> 🩸 Peripheral (Hormonal) Regulators -  Hunger‑Promoting (“Orexigenic”)
> 
> - **Ghrelin** — “hunger hormone” from the stomach; rises before meals, stimulates NPY/AgRP neurons.
> 
> 🩸 Peripheral (Hormonal) Regulators -  Satiety‑Promoting (“Anorexigenic”)
> - **Leptin** — from fat tissue; signals long‑term energy stores to the hypothalamus.
> - **Insulin** — post‑meal satiety signal; also modulates brain reward circuits.
> - **Peptide YY (PYY)** — from the gut after eating; slows gastric emptying, reduces appetite.
> - **GLP‑1** — from the gut; enhances satiety, slows gastric emptying (basis for GLP‑1 drugs).
> - **Cholecystokinin (CCK)** — from the small intestine; promotes meal termination.
> - **Amylin** — from the pancreas; slows gastric emptying, promotes satiety.
> - **Oxyntomodulin** — gut hormone that reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure.
> 
> ⚙️ Other Modulators
> - **Cortisol & stress hormones** — can increase or decrease appetite depending on context.
> - **Sex hormones** — oestrogen tends to suppress appetite; progesterone can increase it.
> - **Thyroid hormones** — influence metabolic rate and hunger indirectly.
> - **Inflammatory cytokines** — during illness, can blunt appetite (“sickness behaviour”).
> - **Sensory cues** — smell, taste, and visual stimuli can override homeostatic signals.
> - **Circadian rhythms** — hypothalamic clock genes influence feeding patterns.

Here's a cheap and easy thing to try which will suppress your appetite: buy L-Tryptophan and L-Tyrosine powders on amazon, mix 30g of each into a litre of water in the morning and sip it throughout the day and see what happens to your apetite.

**Note**: This will stop you from getting the benefits of fasting if you are trying to do that (yes, sipping this and not eating anything will stop your body from going into "fasting mode"). Using this all the way up until you go to sleep will affect your sleep quality - probably negatively.

## How to Suppress Apetite
Manipulating any of the regulators detailed in the last section will give you power over your apetite. If you care to, you could look up supplements, medications, drugs, foods, techniques, lifestyle habits, etc which affect each of the regulators and come up with some interesting ways of suppressing apetite. Your options are numerous.

### Anoretics
Anoretics are [compounds](../../glossary.md#compound) which reduce apetite. They do this via the regulators detailed above.

Here's a list of some prescription, OTC and natural anoretics:
