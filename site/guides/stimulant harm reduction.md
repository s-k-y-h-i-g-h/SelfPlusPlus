# Risk Factors
## Cardiovascular
Stimulants, especially in high doses, can increase blood pressure and heart rate to dangerous levels.

### When is a Crisis Occurring?
You should at least know what blood pressure readings constitute a hypertensive crisis and what normal readings look like without having to look it up. Same with heart rate and tachyarrhythmic crisis.

A hypertensive crisis is when your systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) is 180 mmHg or above or your diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) is above 120 mmHg. A normal reading is 120/80 mmHg.

A tachyarrhythmic crisis is when your heart rate is 150 bpm. A normal heart rate is 80.

### Measuring Your Vitals
If you are using stimulants recreationally you really ought to buy a blood pressure monitor. There are ones which go on your wrist which are a good budget option, there are traditional ones which go on your upper arm and will get you a more accurate reading than a wrist monitor. Some smartwatches can also measure blood pressure but they require a real blood pressure monitor for calibration. There are also continuous 24 hour blood pressure monitors called ambulatory blood pressure monitors. These are a lot more expensive than the wrist and upper arm monitors but can provide information which may save your life so it is worth investing in one.

### Essentials
Anyone using recreational doses of stimulants should have the following things on hand:
- A potassium supplement
- Table salt
- Water
- A blood pressure med like Losartan (safe and effective)
- Something which increases GABA activity like L-Theanine (effective in high doses: 500-1000mg)
- Asprin (take a low dose - about 70mg or a quarter of a pill) for stroke and heart attack prevention

### Troubleshooting
#### High BP and High HR
- 1g L-Theanine
- 2-4g potassium bicarbonate if not already past UL (Tolerable Upper Inake Level)
- Water if dehydrated 

#### High BP
- Could be caused by low water or potassium but not sodium

#### High HR
- Could be caused by low sodium, low potassium, low water

### Do Not
- Exercise when your heart rate is too high (but you can exercise if your blood pressure is high and exercise will help lower it)
- Fast on stimulants without consuming electrolytes
- Forget to measure your vitals when you are using high/recreational doses
- Go above the recommended upper intake amounts of water, sodium and potassium (unless you have puked up or something)

### Do
- Keep track of what you eat and in particular how much sodium and potassium you have consumed and how much water your have drunk

## Neurotoxicity, Organ Toxicity and Oxidation
tl;dr - take anti-oxidants
