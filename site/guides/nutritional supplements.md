Again, I can't be bothered to do this right now but I have to so here's the [tl;dr](../glossary.md#tl-dr).

You can get supplements for every essential nutrient. I don't know or care if it's cheaper to get them separately or combined (like in multivitamins).

The form of the supplement can affect how effective (the technical term is [bioavailable](../glossary.md#bioavailability)) it is. I'm not a fucking search engine and this site is not wikipedia so google stuff like "different forms of magnesium and their bioavailablity" to get an idea of what I am talking about.

Other thing is that the mineral (e.g. sodium) and the things you are consuming which contains it (e.g. table salt) weigh different amounts. 1g of table salt will provide your body with 400mg sodium. I would explain what the other 600mg is but it's so complicated that I can't explain it (or maybe I just don't know the answer - who knows!). Same goes for a magnesium supplement. So don't take a 500mg pill of something and assume that you are getting 500mg of the mineral unless the supplement is specifically an elemental form of the mineral in question. "Elemental" as in the element itself.

This trips people new to nutrition up all the time. But it will never trip you up. Nothing will. That's what this site is for. Making you un-trip-up-able. I am your safety net and I am your ladder and I am your map which tells you every point at which it is possible to fall down. The safety nets are there for redundancy. The ladders will be long forgotten soon. See you at the summit!
