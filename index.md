Self++ is a project designed to take you and add a little bit more to improve you and your capabilities past what is normally possible. 

This isn't just for healthy people - if you are suffering from health problems then we intend to help you to overcome them too.

We have provided an [overview](site/overview.md) of this site to serve as an introduction to biohacking, nootropics and transhumanism. It assumes no knowledge of these things and anyone with even an incomplete or informal education should be able to understand it. If anything remains unclear either [talk to us](site/contact.md) or ask AI to explain it to you (please see [this page about how to use AI](site/guides/AI.md) if you are new to it).

This is an [open source project](site/oss.md). It is open to everyone both to use and to modify.

This project is the result of one biohacker's need to share the cool stuff they've found and learned.
